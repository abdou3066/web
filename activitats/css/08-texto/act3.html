                Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
                and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. 
                It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. 
                Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; 
                whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; 
                and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me 
                from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
